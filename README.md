# Advanced - Thermofluids

Engineering Tripos Part IIB 

Please view the following folder: Solar Thermal Absorption Cooling if you are interested in viewing an absoprtion cooling cycle. This system consists of 2 seperate cycles working simultaneously, with one taking in solar thermal energy and concentrating it into a superheated vapor, and the other generates a cooling effect for an environment. Further adjustments can be made to this base code if you wish to achieve different cooling temperatures. To view the finalised report, please open the file 'Joseph Jolley jrj44 - SolarThermal.pdf'

Both cycles are desinged to operate at vacuums, making the pracitcal feasibility very realistic.

The first cycles working fluid is simply water, whilst the second cycle has 2 working fluids working in the different streams, including; LiBr-H2O and H2O. LiBr-H2O is non toxic to the environment, in constrast to R134a, hence making this ever more so attractive for practical implementation. This can be implemented in any geographical location in very hot climates, with average daily irradiance > 500W/m^2 in the summer months. Providing ~>90% carbon free air conditioning, with the use of non toxic working fluids.

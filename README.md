# Advanced - Thermofluids

Engineering Tripos Part IIB 

Please view the following folder: Solar Thermal Absorption Cooling if you are interested in viewing an absoprtion cooling cycle. This system consists of 2 seperater cycles working simultaneous, with one taking in solar thermal energy, and the other generating a cooling effect for an environment. Further adjustments can be made to this base code if you wish to achieve different cooling temperatures. 

The first cycles working fluid is simply water, whilst the second cycle has 2 working fluids working in the different streams, including; LiBr-H2O and H2O.
